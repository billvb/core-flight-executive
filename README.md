cfe
===

This framework is used as the basis for the flight software for satellite data systems and instruments, but can be used on other embedded systems.

Note that I removed the test-and-ground folder under the cfe/ directory. This added several dozen megabytes to the size of the repo without adding much value. If you need any documents from within that folder, you can get it from the tar file.
