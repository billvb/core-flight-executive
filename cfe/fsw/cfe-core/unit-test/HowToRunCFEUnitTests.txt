Running the CFE Unit tests

The CFE Core unit tests are run from the fsw/build/cpuX directory, where cpuX is either cpu1, cpu2, or cpu3. The unit tests themselves are stored in  fsw/cfe-core/unit-test directory.

1. Edit the fsw/build/cpuX/cfe-config.mak for your test platform
2. Go to the fsw/build/cpuX/cfe/unit-test/ directory
3. Build the unit test(s) by typing "make"
4. Run the unit test(s) by typing "make gcov"
5. View Results
6. Reset gcov counters
7. Check-in results (if applicable)

------ Details ------------------------------------

1. Edit the fsw/build/unit-test/cfe-config.mak for your test platform.
In general, the desktop platforms are supported for unit tests:
  x86/PC/linux/linux
  x86/mac/osx/osx
  x86/PC/linux/cygwin
  ppc/mac/osx/osx

2. Go to the fsw/build/cpuX/cfe/unit-test/ directory

3. Build the unit test(s) by typing "make"
   From the fsw/build/cpuX/cfe/unit-test/ directory
   $ make
   or 
   $ make clean
 
   You can build and run the test for an individual subsystem too:
   $ cd fsw/build/cpu1/cfe/unit-test/sb
   $ make
   or 
   $ make clean

   
4. Run the unit test:

   From the same directory as step 3:

   $ make gcov


5. View results
Coverage results will be displayed in the terminal where it has run.
see  fsw/build/cpuX/cfe/unit-test/xx/ut_cfe_xx_log.txt for unit test output
see  fsw/build/cpuX/cfe/unit-test/xx/cfe_xx_???.c.gcov for detailed coverage results.
 ##### in file means the line has not been executed.

6. Reset coverage counters
To reset the counts in the *.gcov file, you must recompile the subsystem and copy it to the unit-test directory.

7. To check-in results (if applicable)
Each subsystem should have a ut_cfe_XX_log.txt file. 
Before adding this to the repository or checking it in - append the "Coverage results:" to the end of the file. 
The coverage results are printed to the console when the test is executed.

Also, If any file is not covered 100%, we need to check in the corresponding *.gcov file to show exactly what lines have not been covered. 
In most cases, at a minimum this should be the cfe_xx_task.c.gov file since the forever loop will not have coverage.

All files specifying results should be checked into the corresponding subproject under the unit-test subproject. (i.e.SbResults subproject in fsw/cfe-core/unit-test/)
