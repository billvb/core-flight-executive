The EVS Services unit test results are expected to have the
following results for each of the EVS services source files:

==========================================================================

cfe_evs.c - 100.00 % coverage

==========================================================================

cfe_evs_utils.c - 100.00% coverage

==========================================================================

cfe_evs_log.c - 100.00% coverage

==========================================================================

cfe_evs_task.c - 99.63 % coverage ( 2 lines not executed)

The code snippet of the 2 lines not covered are:

        2:  263:    Status = CFE_EVS_SendEvent(CFE_EVS_STARTUP_EID, 
        -:  264:                               CFE_EVS_INFORMATION, 
        -:  265:                               "cFE EVS Initialized");
        2:  266:    if(Status != CFE_SUCCESS)
        -:  267:    {
    #####:  268:      CFE_ES_WriteToSysLog("EVS:Error sending init event:RC=0x%08X\n",Status);
    #####:  269:      return Status;
        -:  270:    }/* end if */

The reason these two lines are not executed is because we are checking the
return of another EVS function call. That EVS function cannot be stubbed out
because this is a unit test of EVS.
