**      -# ES will set the control request for an App to Delete/Restart/Reload and
**         set this kill timer to the value in this parameter.
**      -# If the App is reponding and Calls it's RunLoop function, it will drop out
**         of it's main loop and call CFE_ES_ExitApp. Once it calls Exit App, then
**         ES can delete, restart, or reload the app the next time it scans the app
**         table.
**      -# If the App is not responding, the ES App will decrement this Kill Timeout
**         value each time it runs. If the timeout value reaches zero, ES will kill
**         the app.
**
**      The Kill timeout value depends on the #CFE_ES_APP_SCAN_RATE. If the Scan Rate
**      is 1000, or 1 second, and this #CFE_ES_APP_KILL_TIMEOUT is set to 5, then it
**      will take 5 seconds to kill a non-responding App.
**      If the Scan Rate is 250, or 1/4 second, and the #CFE_ES_APP_KILL_TIMEOUT is
**      set to 2, then it will take 1/2 second to time out.
